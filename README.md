# Motivations
- Implement what I've learned so far from my work
- Track my expense
- Side project
- Hopefully it can be a side hustle

# Ideas
- Web app using React as front-end
- Customize Schema
- Input using web app
- PostgreSQL to store the record
  Still deciding on this one. I'd like to use SQLite.
- Back-end is Rest API
- Show charts
- Drilldown chart

# Notes
Ideally, there is an engine (or parser) to parse PDF file.
It read PDF file as an input, parse it and *intelligently* get the data
from the table inside of it. Once it get the data, it will store it to the database.

Now this is **hard**. It should somehow know how to parse the PDF and get the data correctly.
I've been digging about this for quite sometime and I still couldn't find anything
that come close to it.

So, instead of being stuck finding the engine (or parser), I started thinking about the front-end.
